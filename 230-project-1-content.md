## Proposal
---
### Game Concept
Discover the body, find the clues, and catch the murderer before it's too late.

### Game Genre
Text based Adventure Mystery

### Game Platform
Desktop and mobile - friendly

### Game Story
You've been invited to a grand ball, when sudenly the lights go out 
            and you hear a loud thud. Someone has been killed and it's up to you to
            find the clues that lead to the murderer and catch them before they escape.

            The player progresses through the game by entering text commands in order to 
            interact with their environment. It has an urgent but careful mood since you need
            to catch the murderer but don't want to acuse the wrong person.
### Game Aesthetics
* Graphics style: cartoonish but heading towards photo-realistic depending on time
* Sound: ambient
* Types of sound: background music that might change depending on the situation, UI sounds
### Game Gameplay
The player can enter specific text commands with the keyboard in order to interact with different 
            scenes in the game. The player may be able to select different objects with the mouse or through touch.
 The player is taught how to play the game though integrated gameplay. The text will show up in the players
            text terminal and will teach new commands as they are neededThe player needs to learn different commands in order to navigate and interact with the world. These can
            include: look, pick up, move, use, open, and combine.

## Documentation
* Project Overall
So far I have layed out the content to be included the foundation to implement the css. 
            While the content might change a bit over time, this will probably be the main organization. The
            resources I have used include: the posted project proposal outline, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_code.asp">w3schools</a>,
            and my own images. This is the basic prototype of how it will be organized and more css will 
            help the layout look nicer.
